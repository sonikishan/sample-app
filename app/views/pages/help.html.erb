<h1>Help</h1>
<p>This is where the incredibly useful help text would go, were I of a mind to write any.</p>
<p>However, since I don't feel like adding any useful text, you might try looking at the

<p>You might also want to take a gander at the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book">Rails Tutorial book</a>.</p>
